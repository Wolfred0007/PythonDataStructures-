What is Python?
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, Python is widely used for various applications, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. Its design philosophy prioritizes code readability through the use of significant indentation, making it accessible for beginners and efficient for experienced developers

Python is an interpreted language or a hybrid language. Explain. 
Python is fundamentally an interpreted language, its compilation step and dynamic features contribute to a hybrid nature, combining the benefits of both interpreted and compiled languages.
